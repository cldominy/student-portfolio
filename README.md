# Chris Dominy's Portfolio Website
This website was built using responsive design and Bootstrap It's mostly used to host links to my finished and published Github projects, as I work and complete them! I hope to eventually to continue to customize my website and integrated new features as I learn more programming languages. 

# Preview of the Website and Responsive Design
I created this website to look as asethetically pleasing on different devices while still keeping all the functions user-friendly. Below is a preview of the 992, 786, and 400 resolution screenshots respectively
